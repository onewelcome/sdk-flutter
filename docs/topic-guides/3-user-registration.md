# User registration

## Introduction

User registration is a fundamental part of the Onegini Mobile Security Platform. As developer you have a couple options to handle this process:

## Register by default browser

To start the user registration using WebView or browser you can `Onegini.instance.userClient.registerUser(BuildContext context, String? identityProviderId, String scopes)` method. Calling this method will launch a browser where you need to register. If registration is successful, the browser will return a link that can be caught. After the registration process is completed, the method will return the string value of `userId`. This will mean that the user has successfully registered. 

    var userId = await Onegini.instance.userClient
        .registerUser(context, identityProviderId, "read")
        .catchError((error) {
            print("Registration failed: " + error.message);
        });

    if (userId != null) {
        print("Registration success!");
    }

## Choosing an identity provider

To select an identity provider which will be used during the registration process you need to pass its id in the place of the `identityProviderId` param. To choose an identity provider, first you need to get all available providers. Call the method `Onegini.instance.userClient.getRegisteredAuthenticators(context)` to get a list with available providers id. If this parameter isnâ€™t specified or if its value is `null` the default identity provider set on the **Token Server** will be used.
